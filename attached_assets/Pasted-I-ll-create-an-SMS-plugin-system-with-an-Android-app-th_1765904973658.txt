Complete guide to replace Twilio with your own Android phone SMS system.

## 🎯 System Overview

This system consists of:
1. **SMS Server** - Python Flask API that manages SMS queue
2. **Android App** - Sends SMS using phonPerfect! I've created a complete SMS gateway system to replace Twilio. Here's what I built for you:
📦 What You Got:

SMS Server (Python Flask) - Backend API that manages the SMS queue and handles requests from your booking system
Android App - Full Android application that connects to your server and sends SMS using the phone's SIM card
Booking System Integration - Python client code to easily integrate with your existing booking system
Complete Setup Guide - Step-by-step instructions for everything

🎯 How It Works:

Your booking system sends SMS request to the Flask server via API
The server queues the message
The Android app polls the server every 5 seconds for new messages
When messages are found, the app sends them using the phone's SIM card
Delivery status is reported back to the server

💡 Key Features:

✅ No monthly Twilio fees - just your SIM card plan
✅ Simple REST API - easy to integrate
✅ Real-time SMS sending through Android phone
✅ Delivery status tracking
✅ Multiple device support
✅ Queue management for reliable delivery

🚀 Quick Start:

Run the Python server
Build and install the Android app (or I can provide a pre-built APK if needed)
Connect the app to your server
Replace your Twilio code with the provided Python client
Start sending SMS through your own phone!
